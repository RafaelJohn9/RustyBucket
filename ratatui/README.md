## 🐀✨ **Remy’s Rat-tastrophe!**

*A Ratatouille-Inspired Tale of Culinary Chaos and Code*

---

### 🎥 Opening Scene

It’s a cozy night in Paris. The Eiffel Tower sparkles like a sugar-dusted croissant in the distance. Inside *La Ratatouille*, things are... not so sparkly.

Behind the scenes of Remy’s famed restaurant, it’s all **pasta and panic**.

---

### 🎭 Cast of Chaos

* **Remy** – world-class rat chef, culinary visionary, *organizational disaster*. He can reduce a grown food critic to tears with a spoonful of soup, but he doesn’t know how many tables he has, let alone who ordered what.
* **Linguini** – tall, flustered, and perpetually tripping over his own shoelaces. Remy tries to give him orders, but Linguini still thinks “mise en place” is a French yoga pose.
* **Colette** – armed with knives sharper than her wit. She runs the kitchen with an iron skillet but is losing her patience. “How is a rat more organized than we are!?” she yells (while secretly admiring Remy’s genius).
* **Django** – Remy’s dad, visiting with a “few dozen” cousins from the colony. They want to help. Sort of. Not really. Chaos follows.

### 🧾 The Problem: A Spaghetti Mess

Remy’s cooking is still world-class, but the kitchen is running on **chaotic scribbles and desperate guesses**:

* Orders are taken on *crumpled napkins*.
* Menu items change daily — no one remembers what’s available.
* A rat in the pantry *ate* the last remaining ticket for Table 7.
* One time, the same dish was served to three tables… and none of them ordered it.

**One critic called the service “avant-garde performance art.”**
Remy cried into a bowl of onion soup for an hour.

### 🧠 Remy’s Big Idea

“Okay… what if we stop using napkins for order-taking,” Remy squeaks one night, “and start using… code?”

Everyone blinks.

“Code?” Linguini tilts his head.
“Like… the thing humans write when they’re not burning toast?”

“Yes,” Remy nods. “I’ve been learning something called **Rust**.”

Cue gasps.

“Why Rust?” Colette raises an eyebrow.

“Because it’s safe. Fast. And we can’t afford another *segfault soufflé*.”

### 🛠️ Your Mission

You — a bright young rat coder from the colony — have been called in by Remy himself. He needs you to build the **first ever kitchen command center**, powered by Rust.

You’re not building the entire Eiffel Tower here — just something to help with:

* 🧾 **Tracking customer orders**
* 🧂 **Listing dishes and their ingredients**
* 🧪 **Marking orders as cooking or served**
* 🎩 **Keeping things clean, modular, and scalable — because Chef Gusteau believed: “Anyone can code.”**

All while working within the tiny (but mighty!) toolbox of your early Rust knowledge.

---

### 🧚‍♀️ Magical Twist?

Feel free to add:

* A sprinkle of **rat magic** — maybe the system can speak “ratish” and humans can’t read it.
* A hidden **“pasta panic mode”** that triggers when orders pile up.
* A *daily quote from Gusteau* as startup flavor text.
