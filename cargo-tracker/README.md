# 🚚 cargo-tracker

Welcome to **cargo-tracker** — a Rust-powered CLI that helps you track shipments like a boss… or at least like a semi-competent logistics intern.

## 📦 The (Totally True*) Origin Story

> *In the year 20XX, a humble Rustacean named Ferris the Crab worked at an intergalactic delivery company known as **Crustacean Express™**. One day, Ferris accidentally lost a shipment of space-coconuts meant for the Galactic Emperor’s tropical-themed throne room. Panicked but resourceful, Ferris built a CLI tool using Rust, duct tape, and sheer crab-power to track every shipment in the galaxy with perfect precision.*

> That tool is now open source and known to Earthlings as... **cargo-tracker**.

> *Is this story true? Not even close. But it sounds cooler than “I wanted to practice my Rust skills.”*

Because when your packages are on the line, you need a language that’s:

- ⚡ Fast  
- 🧠 Safe  
- 🧪 Surprisingly fun to write  
- 🍊 Slightly obsessed with memory management  

Also… we’re oxidizing *everything* these days. Why not shipments?
